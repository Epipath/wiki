# Opus
Opus is a reverse engineering framework for MCC allowing users to launch directly into maps and game modes (Theater and Forge) by working with each engine rather than using MCC (Opus does not replace the Steam MCC executable). A valuable time saving tool.

It enables more efficient modding practices than DLL injection through exposing many features such as direct access to runtime code and memory in addition to creation of input and rendering. Advanced pattern matching in the works.
