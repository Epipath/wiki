# Opus
Launch directly into forge and theater maps with the reverse engineering framework Opus. It communicates with game engine DLL's, each one are associated to individual Halo games. This bypasses the default executable for Halo: The Master Chief Collection. It enables more efficient modding practices than DLL injection through exposing features such as direct access to runtime code and memory including input and rendering.
